"""OpenAI Image Generation API integration.

Planned: ``OpenAIImageGen`` for direct DALL-E / GPT Image API calls.

Note: For image generation as a *tool* within agent workflows, use
``OpenAITool.image_generation()`` which runs server-side via the
Responses API.  This module is for standalone image generation.
